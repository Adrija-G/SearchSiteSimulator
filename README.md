# GoogleClone
Made with HTML & CSS, this is a front-end model that is designed to perform all the functions of a standard Internet search engine. 
The website has three pages- Google search (called index.html), Google Images Search. 
On the Google Search page, the user will be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and will taken to the Google search results for that page. 
On the Google Image Search page, the user will be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page. 
Searching with the help of the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button on the main Google Search page (also can found on the Google Images page :) ), will direct to the first Google search result for the query, skipping over the normal search results page.
